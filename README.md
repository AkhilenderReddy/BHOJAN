Our web app connects NGOs and individuals to reduce food waste by enabling surplus food donations from events, functions, or hotels. Users can find NGOs, create accounts, and donate. NGOs raise food requests, and donors can fulfill them. A real-time chat feature ensures smooth communication, enhancing the donation process efficiently.
